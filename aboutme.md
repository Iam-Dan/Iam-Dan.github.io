before anything Im a huge Patrick Jane fan - wit sharp enough to disarm anyone, charm to match, and the kind of calm confidence I secretly aspire to.

## Things that make me Human

🩺 **Profession**
An accidental doctor who stayed for the love of it. I won’t pretend to be perfect at what I do, but I’m deeply passionate about medicine, curious by nature, and committed to growing with every patient and every mistake.

🎥 **A Taste for Film and Series**
A cinephile at heart, with a deep appreciation for both movies and TV shows. Recommending the right watch for the right mood is my quiet superpower—whether you’re seeking comfort, chaos, or something that lingers long after the credits roll. Cinema is my safe place, where stories make sense even when the world doesn’t.

💻 **Tech-Savvy**
Tech-savvy by instinct, I have a knack for finding the right gadget at the right price. Google is my trusted accomplice, but judgment, patience, and a healthy dose of skepticism do the real work.

📷 **Travel and Photography**
I dream of travel more than I manage it, always aspiring to see the world when time allows. I carry a Canon EOS 200D with me, knowing I haven’t explored its full potential yet—but every journey, planned or imagined, sharpens the eye and fuels the urge to wander.

🎮 **Stories you can Play**
Gaming has been a constant since childhood, evolving from a pastime into a lasting interest. I’ve grown up with PlayStation—owning the PS1, PS2, PS4, and even a PSP along the way—and it remains my platform of choice. Among many great titles, Red Dead Redemption 2 stands out as a favorite, for its storytelling, depth, and the way it turns play into an experience.

🏆 **Love for the Game**
My interest in sports began with cricket, both as a player and a fan. Over time, football became my preferred game. Rather than following teams religiously, I enjoy sports for the experience, energy, and simple joy of play.
