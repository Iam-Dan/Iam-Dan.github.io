## The Resourceful friend
***
**Movie Recommendations You’ll Actually Enjoy:** I take movie recommendations seriously. Whether it’s a hidden gem, a well-written series, or a comfort rewatch, I usually suggest things that make you come back and say, “That was a good one.” 
<br/>
**Deal Hunter by Nature:** Sales don’t scare me—I prepare for them. From online discounts to value-for-money finds, I enjoy hunting down the best deals before they disappear or turn out to be a trap 
<br/>
**Above-Average Financial Sense:** I’m not a financial guru, but I give practical, sensible advice. The kind that helps you think twice before spending, investing, or making impulsive decisions you’ll regret later.
