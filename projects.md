## The Smart Wallet Guide
***
**Investments & Insurance**<br/>
Never mix investments and insurance—insurance is for protection, not returns. All you really need is term insurance and health insurance.<br/>
When it comes to investing, my rule is simple: start early and diversify. Time does the rest.
here's a [Detailed Guide](https://reddit.com/r/mutualfunds/w/index) to kick start your mutual fund investing<br/><br/>
**Buy Frugal & Buy Cheap**<br/>
The two don’t always go together. Patience is the real superpower—wishlist high-quality things and buy only when the timing (and price) is right.
this [Website](https://www.desidime.com) helps me track down the best deals for the best price<br/><br/>
**Credit Cards**<br/>
Used wisely, they’re one of the best financial tools for discounts, rewards, and savings—most people just don’t know how to make them work for them.
A [Forum](https://technofino.in/community/) that immensely helped me understand credit cards.<br/>

## Digital and Tech Hacks
***
**How I Dodge Spam Calls**<br/>
Download and register for [TRAI DND](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=trai.gov.in.dnd) app,file a complaint for every spam call, at least a month and watch thier numbers disappear.
Somewhere, a spammer hesitates before dialing you. Trust me this actually works.<br/><br/>
**Trust Issues? Ask a Geek**<br/>
Skip influencer hype and sponsored reviews.
Instead, hang out in developer and [tech-enthusiast forums](https://techenclave.com/) where people actually use the gadgets they recommend.<br/>
Bonus: when these folks upgrade, they sell their old gear—well-maintained, fairly priced, and usually cared for like a pet.
Great advice, honest reviews, and pre-owned electronics that don’t feel like a gamble.
