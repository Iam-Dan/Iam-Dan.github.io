## Financial Management

**Investments & Insurance**<br/>
Never mix investments and insurance—insurance is for protection, not returns. All you really need is term insurance and health insurance.
When it comes to investing, my rule is simple: start early and diversify. Time does the rest.

**Buy Frugal & Buy Cheap**<br/>
The two don’t always go together. Patience is the real superpower—wishlist high-quality things and buy only when the timing (and price) is right.
